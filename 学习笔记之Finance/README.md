* [Stock market simulator - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_market_simulator)
  * A stock market simulator is computer software that reproduces behavior and features of a stock market, so that a user may practice trading stocks without financial risk. `Paper trading`, sometimes also called "virtual stock trading", is a simulated trading process in which would-be investors can practice investing without committing money.[1]
* [Paper Trade Definition](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/papertrade.asp)
  * A paper trade is a simulated trade that allows an investor to practice buying and selling without risking real money. The term dates back to a time when (before the proliferation of online trading platforms) aspiring traders would practice on paper before risking money in live markets. While learning, a paper trader records all trades by hand to keep track of hypothetical trading positions, portfolios, and profits or losses. Today, most practice trading involves the use of an electronic stock market simulator, which looks and feels like an actual trading platform.
  * KEY TAKEAWAYS
    * Paper trading is simulated trading that allows investors to practice buying and selling securities.
    * Paper trading can test a new investment strategy before employing it in a live account.
    * Many online brokers offer clients paper trade accounts.
    * Paper trades teach novices how to navigate platforms and make trades, but may not represent the true emotions that occur during real market conditions.
* [Backtesting - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backtesting)
  * Backtesting is a term used in modeling to refer to testing a predictive model on historical data. Backtesting is a type of retrodiction, and a special type of cross-validation applied to previous time period(s).
* [Backtesting Definition](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/backtesting.asp)
  * Backtesting is the general method for seeing how well a strategy or model would have done ex-post. Backtesting assesses the viability of a trading strategy by discovering how it would play out using historical data. If backtesting works, traders and analysts may have the confidence to employ it going forward.
  * KEY TAKEAWAYS
    * Backtesting assesses the viability of a trading strategy or pricing model by discovering how it would have played out retrospectively using historical data.
    * The underlying theory is that any strategy that worked well in the past is likely to work well in the future, and conversely, any strategy that performed poorly in the past is likely to perform poorly in the future.
    * When testing an idea on historical data, it is beneficial to reserve a time period of historical data for testing purposes. If it is successful, testing it on alternate time periods or out-of-sample data can help confirm its potential viability.
* [Understanding Value at Risk (VaR) and How It's Computed](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/var.asp#:~:text=VaR%20modeling%20determines%20the%20potential,of%20loss%2C%20and%20the%20timeframe.)
  * What Is Value at Risk (VaR)?
    * Value at risk (VaR) is a statistic that quantifies the extent of possible financial losses within a firm, portfolio, or position over a specific time frame. This metric is most commonly used by investment and commercial banks to determine the extent and probabilities of potential losses in their institutional portfolios.
    * Risk managers use VaR to measure and control the level of risk exposure. One can apply VaR calculations to specific positions or whole portfolios or use them to measure firm-wide risk exposure.
    * KEY TAKEAWAYS
      * Value at risk (VaR) is a way to quantify the risk of potential losses for a firm or an investment.
      * This metric can be computed in several ways, including the historical, variance-covariance, and Monte Carlo methods.
      * Investment banks commonly apply VaR modeling to firm-wide risk due to the potential for independent trading desks to unintentionally expose the firm to highly correlated assets.
* [Forex (FX): Definition, How to Trade Currencies, and Examples](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/forex.asp)
  * What is Forex (FX)?
    * Forex (FX) refers to the global electronic marketplace for trading international currencies and currency derivatives. It has no central physical location, yet the forex market is the largest, most liquid market in the world by trading volume, with trillions of dollars changing hands every day. Most of the trading is done through banks, brokers, and financial institutions.
    * The forex market is open 24 hours a day, five days a week, except for holidays. The forex market is open on many holidays on which stock markets are closed, though the trading volume may be lower.
    * Its name, forex, is a portmanteau of foreign and exchange. It's often abbreviated as fx.
    * KEY TAKEAWAYS
      * Forex (FX) market is a global electronic network for currency trading.
      * Formerly limited to governments and financial institutions, individuals can now directly buy and sell currencies on forex.
      * In the forex market, a profit or loss results from the difference in the price at which the trader bought and sold a currency pair.
      * Currency traders do not deal in cash. Brokers generally roll over their positions at the end of each day.
* [What Is a Commodity and Understanding Its Role in the Stock Market](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/commodity.asp)
  * What Is a Commodity?
    * A commodity is a basic good used in commerce that is interchangeable with other goods of the same type. Commodities are most often used as inputs in the production of other goods or services. A commodity thus usually refers to a raw material used to manufacture finished goods. A product, on the other hand, is the finished good sold to consumers.
    * The quality of a given commodity may differ slightly, but it is essentially uniform across producers. When they are traded on an exchange, commodities must also meet specified minimum standards, also known as a basis grade.
    * KEY TAKEAWAYS
      * A commodity is a basic good used in commerce that is interchangeable with other commodities of the same type.
      * Commodities are most often used as inputs in the production of other goods or services.
      * Investors and traders can buy and sell commodities directly in the spot (cash) market or via derivatives such as futures and options.
      * Hard commodities refer to energy and metals products while soft commodities are often agricultural goods.
      * Owning commodities in a broader portfolio is encouraged as a hedge against inflation.
* [Credit Derivative: Definition, Types, and Potential Misuse](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/creditderivative.asp)
  * What Is a Credit Derivative?
    * A credit derivative is a financial contract that allows parties to minimize their exposure to credit risk. Credit derivatives consist of a privately held, negotiable bilateral contract traded over-the-counter (OTC) between two parties in a creditor/debtor relationship. These allow the creditor to effectively transfer some or all of the risk of a debtor defaulting to a third party. This third party accepts the risk in return for payment, known as the premium.
    * Several types of credit derivatives exist, including:
      * Credit default swaps (CDS)
      * Collateralized debt obligations (CDO)
      * Total return swaps
      * Credit spread options/forwards
    * In all cases, the price of a credit derivative is driven by the creditworthiness of the party or parties involved. Often a credit derivative will be triggered by a qualifying credit event, such as a default, missed interest payment, credit downgrade, or bankruptcy.
    * KEY TAKEAWAYS
      * A credit derivative allows creditors to transfer to a third party the potential risk of the debtor defaulting, in exchange for paying a fee, known as the premium.
      * A credit derivative is a contract whose value depends on the creditworthiness or a credit event experienced by the entity referenced in the contract.
      * Credit derivatives include credit default swaps, collateralized debt obligations, total return swaps, credit default swap options, and credit spread forwards.

### [HFT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-frequency_trading)

* High-frequency trading (HFT) is a type of algorithmic financial trading characterized by high speeds, high turnover rates, and high order-to-trade ratios that leverages high-frequency financial data and electronic trading tools.[1] While there is no single definition of HFT, among its key attributes are highly sophisticated algorithms, co-location, and very short-term investment horizons.[2] HFT can be viewed as a primary form of algorithmic trading in finance.[3][4] Specifically, it is the use of sophisticated technological tools and computer algorithms to rapidly trade securities.[5][6][7] HFT uses proprietary trading strategies carried out by computers to move in and out of positions in seconds or fractions of a second.[8]

* [Low latency (capital markets) - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_latency_(capital_markets))
  * In capital markets, low latency is the use of algorithmic trading to react to market events faster than the competition to increase profitability of trades. For example, when executing arbitrage strategies the opportunity to "arb" the market may only present itself for a few milliseconds before parity is achieved. To demonstrate the value that clients put on latency, in 2007 a large global investment bank has stated that every millisecond lost results in $100m per annum in lost opportunity.[1]
  * What is considered "low" is therefore relative but also a self-fulfilling prophecy. Many organisations and companies are using the words "ultra low latency" to describe latencies of under 1 millisecond, but it is an evolving definition, with the amount of time considered "low" ever-shrinking.
  * There are many technical factors which impact on the time it takes a trading system to detect an opportunity and to successfully exploit that opportunity. Firms engaged in low latency trading are willing to invest considerable effort and resources to increase the speed of their trading technology as the gains can be significant. This is often done in the context of high-frequency trading.

* [Volatility (finance) - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volatility_(finance))
  * In finance, volatility (usually denoted by σ) is `the degree of variation of a trading price series over time`, usually measured by `the standard deviation of logarithmic returns`.
  * Historic volatility measures a time series of past market prices. Implied volatility looks forward in time, being derived from the market price of a market-traded derivative (in particular, an option).
  * Volatility for investors
    * Volatility affects pricing of options, being a parameter of the Black–Scholes model.
* [Black–Scholes model - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black%E2%80%93Scholes_model)
  * The Black–Scholes /ˌblæk ˈʃoʊlz/[1] or Black–Scholes–Merton model is a mathematical model for the dynamics of a financial market containing derivative investment instruments. From the parabolic partial differential equation in the model, known as the Black–Scholes equation, one can deduce the Black–Scholes formula, which gives a theoretical estimate of the price of European-style options and shows that the option has a unique price given the risk of the security and its expected return (instead replacing the security's expected return with the risk-neutral rate). The equation and model are named after economists Fischer Black and Myron Scholes; Robert C. Merton, who first wrote an academic paper on the subject, is sometimes also credited.
  * `The main principle behind the model is to hedge the option by buying and selling the underlying asset in a specific way to eliminate risk.` This type of hedging is called "continuously revised delta hedging" and is the basis of more complicated hedging strategies such as those engaged in by investment banks and hedge funds.
  * The model is widely used, although often with some adjustments, by options market participants.[2]: 751  The model's assumptions have been relaxed and generalized in many directions, leading to a plethora of models that are currently used in derivative pricing and risk management. The insights of the model, as exemplified by the Black–Scholes formula, are frequently used by market participants, as distinguished from the actual prices. These insights include no-arbitrage bounds and risk-neutral pricing (thanks to continuous revision). Further, the Black–Scholes equation, a partial differential equation that governs the price of the option, enables pricing using numerical methods when an explicit formula is not possible.
  * The Black–Scholes formula has `only one parameter that cannot be directly observed in the market`: `the average future volatility of the underlying asset`, though it can be found from the price of other options. Since the option value (whether put or call) is increasing in this parameter, it can be inverted to produce a "volatility surface" that is then used to calibrate other models, e.g. for OTC derivatives.
* [Greeks (finance) - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greeks_(finance))
  * In mathematical finance, the Greeks are the quantities representing the sensitivity of the price of derivatives such as options to a change in underlying parameters on which the value of an instrument or portfolio of financial instruments is dependent. The name is used because the most common of these sensitivities are denoted by Greek letters (as are some other finance measures). Collectively these have also been called the risk sensitivities,[1] risk measures[2]: 742  or hedge parameters.[3]
  * Use of the Greeks
    * The Greeks are vital tools in risk management. Each Greek measures the sensitivity of the value of a portfolio to a small change in a given underlying parameter, so that component risks may be treated in isolation, and the portfolio rebalanced accordingly to achieve a desired exposure; see for example delta hedging.
    * The Greeks in the Black–Scholes model are relatively easy to calculate, a desirable property of financial models, and are very useful for derivatives traders, especially those who seek to hedge their portfolios from adverse changes in market conditions. For this reason, those Greeks which are particularly useful for hedging—such as delta, theta, and vega—are well-defined for measuring changes in Price, Time and Volatility. Although rho is a primary input into the Black–Scholes model, the overall impact on the value of an option corresponding to changes in the risk-free interest rate is generally insignificant and therefore higher-order derivatives involving the risk-free interest rate are not common.
    * The most common of the Greeks are the first order derivatives: delta, vega, theta and rho as well as gamma, a second-order derivative of the value function. The remaining sensitivities in this list are common enough that they have common names, but this list is by no means exhaustive.
  * First-order Greeks
    * Delta
      * `Delta, measures the rate of change of the theoretical option value with respect to changes in the underlying asset's price.` Delta is the first derivative of the value V of the option with respect to the underlying instrument's price S.
