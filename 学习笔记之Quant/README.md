* [Stock market simulator - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_market_simulator)
  * A stock market simulator is computer software that reproduces behavior and features of a stock market, so that a user may practice trading stocks without financial risk. `Paper trading`, sometimes also called "virtual stock trading", is a simulated trading process in which would-be investors   can practice investing without committing money.[1]
* [Paper Trade Definition](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/papertrade.asp)
  * A paper trade is a simulated trade that allows an investor to practice buying and selling without risking real money. The term dates back to a time when (before the proliferation of online trading platforms) aspiring traders would practice on paper before risking money in live markets. While learning, a paper trader records all trades by hand to keep track of hypothetical trading positions, portfolios, and profits or losses. Today, most practice trading involves the use of an electronic stock market simulator, which looks and feels like an actual trading platform.
  * KEY TAKEAWAYS
    * Paper trading is simulated trading that allows investors to practice buying and selling securities.
    * Paper trading can test a new investment strategy before employing it in a live account.
    * Many online brokers offer clients paper trade accounts.
    * Paper trades teach novices how to navigate platforms and make trades, but may not represent the true emotions that occur during real market conditions.
* [Backtesting - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backtesting)
  * Backtesting is a term used in modeling to refer to testing a predictive model on historical data. Backtesting is a type of retrodiction, and a special type of cross-validation applied to previous time period(s).
* [Backtesting Definition](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/backtesting.asp)
  * Backtesting is the general method for seeing how well a strategy or model would have done ex-post. Backtesting assesses the viability of a trading strategy by discovering how it would play out using historical data. If backtesting works, traders and analysts may have the confidence to employ it going forward.
  * KEY TAKEAWAYS
    * Backtesting assesses the viability of a trading strategy or pricing model by discovering how it would have played out retrospectively using historical data.
    * The underlying theory is that any strategy that worked well in the past is likely to work well in the future, and conversely, any strategy that performed poorly in the past is likely to perform poorly in the future.
    * When testing an idea on historical data, it is beneficial to reserve a time period of historical data for testing purposes. If it is successful, testing it on alternate time periods or out-of-sample data can help confirm its potential viability.

## [HFT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-frequency_trading)

* High-frequency trading (HFT) is a type of algorithmic financial trading characterized by high speeds, high turnover rates, and high order-to-trade ratios that leverages high-frequency financial data and electronic trading tools.[1] While there is no single definition of HFT, among its key attributes are highly sophisticated algorithms, co-location, and very short-term investment horizons.[2] HFT can be viewed as a primary form of algorithmic trading in finance.[3][4] Specifically, it is the use of sophisticated technological tools and computer algorithms to rapidly trade securities.[5][6][7] HFT uses proprietary trading strategies carried out by computers to move in and out of positions in seconds or fractions of a second.[8]

* [Low latency (capital markets) - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_latency_(capital_markets))
  * In capital markets, low latency is the use of algorithmic trading to react to market events faster than the competition to increase profitability of trades. For example, when executing arbitrage strategies the opportunity to "arb" the market may only present itself for a few milliseconds before parity is achieved. To demonstrate the value that clients put on latency, in 2007 a large global investment bank has stated that every millisecond lost results in $100m per annum in lost opportunity.[1]
  * What is considered "low" is therefore relative but also a self-fulfilling prophecy. Many organisations and companies are using the words "ultra low latency" to describe latencies of under 1 millisecond, but it is an evolving definition, with the amount of time considered "low" ever-shrinking.
  * There are many technical factors which impact on the time it takes a trading system to detect an opportunity and to successfully exploit that opportunity. Firms engaged in low latency trading are willing to invest considerable effort and resources to increase the speed of their trading technology as the gains can be significant. This is often done in the context of high-frequency trading.
* [What I’ve learned after coding for HFT and Low Latency Systems | LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/what-ive-learned-after-coding-hft-low-latency-systems-ariel/)
  * Choose the right language
  * Keep it all in memory
  * Keep your hardware underutilized
  * Keep context switches to a minimum
  * Keep your reads sequential
  * Non blocking as much as possible
  * Async as much as possible
  * Parallelize as much as possible
