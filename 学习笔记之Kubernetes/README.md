# 学习笔记之Kubernetes

* [Kubernetes | Production-Grade Container Orchestration](https://kubernetes.io/)
  * Kubernetes is an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.
  * It groups containers that make up an application into logical units for easy management and discovery. Kubernetes builds upon 15 years of experience of running production workloads at Google, combined with best-of-breed ideas and practices from the community.
  * [What is Kubernetes? | Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/what-is-kubernetes/)
    * Kubernetes is a portable, extensible open-source platform for managing containerized workloads and services, that facilitates both declarative configuration and automation. It has a large, rapidly growing ecosystem. Kubernetes services, support, and tools are widely available.
    * Google open-sourced the Kubernetes project in 2014. Kubernetes builds upon a decade and a half of experience that Google has with running production workloads at scale, combined with best-of-breed ideas and practices from the community.
  * [Overview of kubectl | Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/overview/)
    * kubectl is a command line interface for running commands against Kubernetes clusters. This overview covers kubectl syntax, describes the command operations, and provides common examples.
  * [Kubernetes | Docker](https://www.docker.com/kubernetes)
    * Adding Kubernetes support in the Docker platform
    * The Docker platform is getting support for Kubernetes. This means that developers and operators can build apps with Docker and seamlessly test and deploy them using both Docker Swarm and Kubernetes.
* [Kubernetes - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kubernetes)
  * Kubernetes (commonly referred to as "K8s") is an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling and management of containerized applications that was originally designed by Google and now maintained by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation. It aims to provide a "platform for automating deployment, scaling, and operations of application containers across clusters of hosts". It works with a range of container tools, including Docker.
